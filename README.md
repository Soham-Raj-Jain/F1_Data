🏎️ Formula 1 Live Data Analysis & Prediction App
This Streamlit app leverages the FastF1 library to deliver real-time Formula 1 data visualization and predictive analytics. Whether you're a motorsport enthusiast, data analyst, or aspiring ML engineer, this dashboard gives you a deep look into lap performances, race pace, and outcome predictions.

📌 Project Description
This project is a comprehensive Formula 1 Data Analysis and Prediction Dashboard, built using Streamlit and powered by FastF1. It focuses on extracting and visualizing live session data including telemetry, lap times, sector splits, and race results to deliver meaningful insights about driver and team performance.

✅ What I’ve Built So Far:
Live Data Integration: The app connects to the FastF1 API to pull data from qualifying and race sessions in real time.

Telemetry Visualizations:

Speed traces, throttle/brake usage, and delta time plots to compare driver laps.

Sector-by-sector analysis to identify where time is gained or lost.

Race Pace Analysis:

Box plots and scatter plots to evaluate consistency and average pace across stints.

Filters by driver, team, and session type.

Prediction Module:

A basic model that estimates finishing positions using qualifying performance, starting grid position, and pace metrics.

🔮 What’s Coming Next:
🧩 Racing Line & Track Map Overlay

Visualize GPS-based racing lines to compare trajectories between drivers.

⏱️ Ideal Lap Construction

Generate ideal laps from each driver’s best sector times.

🟦 Sector Overlay Graphs

Overlay multiple drivers’ sector performance in one plot for quick insights.

🧠 Enhanced Race Prediction Models

Include more variables such as weather, tyre compounds, and pit strategies.

🗂️ Multi-Year Analysis Support

Compare performance trends across seasons, teams, and circuits.

🛠️ User-Controlled Parameters

Filters for driver, team, session type, year, and circuit in a clean UI.

This app serves as a dynamic toolkit for fans, data enthusiasts, and aspiring motorsport analysts.
The project is actively under development—more advanced visualizations, data sources, and predictive features are on the way!
